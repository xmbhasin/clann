# This file specifies which checks are performed by the pre-commit service.
# The pre-commit service prevents people from pushing code to git that is not
# up to standards. # The reason mirrors are used instead of the actual
# repositories for e.g. black and flake8, is because those repositories also
# need to contain a pre-commit hook file, which they often don't by default.
# So to resolve that, a mirror is created that includes such a file.

# Tests if there are spelling errors in the code.
